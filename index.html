        But obviously, we're not here to talk about me! Today, this blog is all about <strong>Webster University</strong>, the fabulous school I get to write about for my Midterm.

      <h2>Brand Evidence Notes</h2>
      <p>For the Midterm Exam submission on Canvas, here is a summary of the brand evidence I followed for this midterm:</p>
      <ul class="brand-evidence">
        <li><strong>Color names:</strong> I used Webster Blue (#024890) as a primary color and Webster Gold (#f5b706) as an accent. I found these on page 9 of the Webster Brand Guidelines.</li>
        <li><strong>Typography:</strong> I used Franklin Gothic Book for body, Franklin Gothic Medium/Demi for headings. I found this font on page 8 of the Webster Brand Guidelines.</li>
        <li><strong>Logo rule:</strong> I used the official Webster logo, maintained proportions, and kept clear space around it. I found this requirement on page 11 of the Webster Brand Guidelines.</li>
<li><strong>Image/photography rule:</strong> I chose images that were clear, well-lit, and look natural. I made sure they reflect Webster authentically as stated on page 20 of Webster Brand Guidelines.</li>
      </ul>
